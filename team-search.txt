Hi! I'm developing OneCarbon, an AI-powered Scope 3 carbon reporting platform, and looking to transform it into a DeFi agent system for the hackathon. 

Project Overview:
- Currently: AI-powered document analysis for carbon footprint tracking with blockchain integration
- Vision: Transform into an automated DeFi agent system for carbon credit trading and optimization

Looking for teammates with these skills:
1. NEAR Protocol Development
   - Smart contract development on NEAR
   - Experience with NEAR SDK
   - Understanding of NEAR wallet integration

2. AI/ML Development
   - Experience with AI agents and autonomous systems
   - Knowledge of market-making algorithms
   - Background in DeFi automation

3. Frontend Development
   - Experience with Next.js/React
   - Web3 integration expertise
   - Data visualization skills

Current Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js 13+, TypeScript, Tailwind
- AI: Document analysis, RAG (planned)
- Blockchain: Currently on Ethereum (planning to migrate to NEAR)

The project already has a working foundation with AI document analysis and blockchain integration. Looking to pivot towards the DeFi Agents track by implementing automated carbon credit trading, yield optimization, and portfolio management.

If you're passionate about combining DeFi, AI, and sustainability, let's build something impactful together!
